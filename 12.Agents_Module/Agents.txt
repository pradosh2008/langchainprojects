# Two types of Agents
----------------------
# 1. Action Agents
# - Received user input
# - Decides which tool, if any, to use and the tool input
# - Calls the tool and records the output (Also known as an "Observation")
# - Decides the next step using the history of tools, tool inputs, and observations.
# - Repeats 3-4 until it determines it can respond directly to the user


# 2. Plan and Execute agents
# - Received user input
# - Plans the full sequence of steps to take
# - Executes the steps in order, passing the outputs of past steps as input to future steps.
